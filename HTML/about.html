                    <p class="about-description">I was most recently a product manager at Tokengate, a ten-person startup specializing in the tokenization of various assets, from financial securities to art & collectibles. 

                    Prior to venturing into the world of tokenization, I used to be an ex-collegiate tennis player from the University of Miami, ranking professionally on the ATP tour. I moved from my hometown in Canada to Miami when I was 12 for the sole purpose of pursuing tennis.
                    
                    During my time at UM, I completed a double major in Business Technology & Finance with a further Masters of Finance while simultaneously playing tennis full-time. In my senior year, I had to come to terms with the sport no longer being a viable career path for me due to funding reasons.
                    
                    I therefore started my professional career in Corporate & Investment Banking at Citigroup, advising global large cap companies on capital structuring, debt financing strategies, and liquidity sizing. I was hesitant to work with a large team & yearning for a startup environment, so I picked a newer group consisting of only four employees. I was therefore accountable for not only the quantitative analysis, but also for crafting qualitative & actionable takeaways, usually the role of directors.</p>

                <div class="about-row">
                  <div class="text-container" id="text-container-2">
                    <p class="about-description">After the first 8 months at Citi & realizing quickly I had a desire for something more, I co-founded TennisT, a platform that enabled access to funding for upcoming tennis players through NFTs tied to their future performance. After years on the tennis tour, I saw first-hand the friends of mine who struggled to pay their entry fees, sleeping in their cars in an effort to save money. We entered into a joint venture with Tokengate four months after inception and I left Citigroup officially to build full-time. After 6 months of having over 100+ calls with players from our personal network & developing a functional backend, we were ultimately beaten out by an incumbent who purchased the exclusive rights to players with large amounts of upfront cash. We fought until the very end and it was bittersweet to call it quits.
 
                      I transitioned to work full-time with Tokengate, becoming one of two employees tasked with expanding into the MENA region, wearing many hats from day one. Over the year, I incubated the tokenized security product from idea to inception, leading overall product strategy, feature specification, roadmap alignment, & user flows. The product ultimately went live in the beginning of August â€˜22. I additionally helped implement tokenization strategies for 15+ clients in MENA. During my time at Tokengate, we successfully raised a $3.7m seed round.</p>
