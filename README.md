# Dane-s-Website

I made this website from scratch using HTML and CSS. 

It is not meant to be a portfolio page for functional purposes, just for learning!

The website is still not very responsive to screen changes or mobile views, but I may add this in the future.

I may also play around with adding javascript components in the future. The website was just to dip my toes into web development :)
