                    <p class="about-description">I was most recently a product manager at Tokengate, a ten-person startup specializing in the tokenization of various assets, from financial securities to art & collectibles. 

                    Prior to venturing into the world of tokenization, I used to be an ex-collegiate tennis player from the University of Miami, ranking professionally on the ATP tour. I moved from my hometown in Canada to Miami when I was 12 for the sole purpose of pursuing tennis.
                    
                    During my time at UM, I completed a double major in Business Technology & Finance with a further Masters of Finance while simultaneously playing tennis full-time. In my senior year, I had to come to terms with the sport no longer being a viable career path for me due to funding reasons.
                    
                    I therefore started my professional career in Corporate & Investment Banking at Citigroup, advising global large cap companies on capital structuring, debt financing strategies, and liquidity sizing. I was hesitant to work with a large team & yearning for a startup environment, so I picked a newer group consisting of only four employees. I was therefore accountable for not only the quantitative analysis, but also for crafting qualitative & actionable takeaways, usually the role of directors.</p>
